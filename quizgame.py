'''Project 9:
You have to build a dictionary (Or any other container of your choice) which contains multiple True/false type quiz questions.
Every participant/user will attempt 5 rounds and in each round random quiz questions will be displayed to the user/participant.
If the participant answers the quiz question correct, then congratulate him and add the scores.
At the end display the details and score of the participant.
(Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)
